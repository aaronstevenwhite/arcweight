**A high-performance, modular Rust library for weighted finite state transducers (WFSTs).**

ArcWeight provides a comprehensive toolkit for constructing, combining, optimizing, and searching weighted finite-state transducers. It offers functionality comparable to [OpenFst](https://www.openfst.org/) with a modern, type-safe Rust API, making it ideal for natural language processing and computational linguistics applications.

## What Are Finite State Transducers?

Finite State Transducers (FSTs) are computational models that define rational relations between strings, enabling the transformation of input sequences into output sequences with associated weights ([Mohri 1997](https://aclanthology.org/J97-2003/)). FSTs have become fundamental tools in computational linguistics and natural language processing for:

- Computing the distance between strings
- Spell checking and correcting text
- Normalizing dates, times, etc.
- Analyzing and generating words

**Why choose ArcWeight over alternatives?**
- ü¶Ä **Pure Rust**: Memory safety, modern tooling, no C++ dependencies
- ‚ö° **Performance**: Optimized algorithms implementing state-of-the-art techniques ([Mohri 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3975(99)00014-6))
- üîß **Flexibility**: Extensible design with custom semirings and FST types
- üìö **Complete**: Comprehensive algorithm suite based on established theoretical foundations

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add ArcWeight to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
arcweight = "0.1"
```

**System Requirements:**
- Rust 1.85.0 or later
- 64-bit architecture (x86_64 or aarch64)

### Your First FST

Here's a simple FST that recognizes the word "hello":

```rust
use arcweight::prelude::*;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create a simple FST
    let mut fst = VectorFst::<TropicalWeight>::new();
    
    // Add states
    let s0 = fst.add_state();
    let s1 = fst.add_state();
    let s2 = fst.add_state();
    let s3 = fst.add_state();
    let s4 = fst.add_state();
    let s5 = fst.add_state();
    
    // Set start and final states
    fst.set_start(s0);
    fst.set_final(s5, TropicalWeight::one());
    
    // Add arcs for "hello"
    fst.add_arc(s0, Arc::new('h' as u32, 'h' as u32, TropicalWeight::one(), s1));
    fst.add_arc(s1, Arc::new('e' as u32, 'e' as u32, TropicalWeight::one(), s2));
    fst.add_arc(s2, Arc::new('l' as u32, 'l' as u32, TropicalWeight::one(), s3));
    fst.add_arc(s3, Arc::new('l' as u32, 'l' as u32, TropicalWeight::one(), s4));
    fst.add_arc(s4, Arc::new('o' as u32, 'o' as u32, TropicalWeight::one(), s5));
    
    // Use the FST - check if "hello" is accepted
    let input = vec!['h' as u32, 'e' as u32, 'l' as u32, 'l' as u32, 'o' as u32];
    let accepted = fst.get_properties().contains(FstProperties::ACCEPTOR);
    
    println!("Created FST with {} states", fst.num_states());
    println!("FST is an acceptor: {}", accepted);
    
    Ok(())
}
```
