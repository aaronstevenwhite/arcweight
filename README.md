A high-performance, modular Rust library for weighted finite state transducers (WFSTs).

ArcWeight provides a comprehensive toolkit for constructing, combining, optimizing, and searching weighted finite-state transducers. It offers functionality comparable to [OpenFst](https://www.openfst.org/) with a modern, type-safe Rust API.

## Features

- üöÄ **High Performance**: Optimized implementations with parallel algorithms support
- üîß **Modular Design**: Trait-based architecture for maximum extensibility
- üìä **Rich Semiring Support**: 
  - Tropical, Probability, Boolean, Log semirings
  - String, MinMax, and Product semirings
  - Custom semiring implementations
- üóÑÔ∏è **Multiple FST Types**: Vector, constant, compact, lazy, and cached implementations
- üîÑ **Comprehensive Algorithm Suite**:
  - Core operations: composition, determinization, minimization
  - Advanced operations: push, prune, project, replace
  - Path operations: shortest path, random path generation
  - Graph operations: connect, synchronize, topsort
- üìÅ **OpenFST Compatible**: Read and write OpenFST format files
- ü¶Ä **Pure Rust**: No C++ dependencies, fully memory safe
- üß™ **Comprehensive Benchmarking**: Performance testing across all major operations:
  - Core algorithms (composition, determinization, minimization)
  - Memory usage and storage efficiency
  - I/O operations and serialization
  - Parallel algorithm performance
  - Optimization algorithms (epsilon removal, weight pushing)

## Quick Start

Add ArcWeight to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
arcweight = "0.1"
```

Basic example:

```rust
use arcweight::prelude::*;

// Create a simple acceptor
let mut fst = VectorFst::<TropicalWeight>::new();
let s0 = fst.add_state();
let s1 = fst.add_state();
let s2 = fst.add_state();

fst.set_start(s0);
fst.set_final(s2, TropicalWeight::one());

// Add weighted transitions
fst.add_arc(s0, Arc::new(1, 1, TropicalWeight::new(0.5), s1));
fst.add_arc(s1, Arc::new(2, 2, TropicalWeight::new(0.3), s2));

// Find the shortest path
let shortest = shortest_path(&fst)?;
```

  ```bash
  cargo run --example edit_distance
  ```

- **`word_correction.rs`** - Dictionary-based spell checking and word correction with fuzzy matching
  ```bash
  cargo run --example word_correction
  ```

### Speech & Phonetics
- **`pronunciation_lexicon.rs`** - Pronunciation dictionary with grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) rules
  ```bash
  cargo run --example pronunciation_lexicon
  ```

- **`phonological_rules.rs`** - Phonological rule systems following Kaplan & Kay's framework
  ```bash
  cargo run --example phonological_rules
  ```

### Morphology & Linguistics
- **`morphological_analyzer.rs`** - Finite state morphology following Karttunen's two-level framework
  ```bash
  cargo run --example morphological_analyzer
  ```

- **`transliteration.rs`** - Cross-script transliteration (Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek to Latin)
  ```bash
  cargo run --example transliteration
  ```

### Text Normalization

  ```

Each example includes detailed documentation in the [Examples Guide](docs/examples/) with theoretical background and implementation details.

## Performance & Benchmarking

ArcWeight is designed for high performance with extensive benchmarking:

- **Zero-copy arc iteration** - Minimal allocations in hot paths
- **Cache-friendly data structures** - Optimized memory layout
- **Parallel algorithms** - Optional Rayon-based parallelization
- **Comprehensive benchmarking suite** covering:
  - Core operations (composition, determinization, minimization)
  - Memory usage and storage efficiency
  - I/O and serialization performance
  - Parallel algorithm scaling
  - Optimization algorithms (epsilon removal, weight pushing)

Run benchmarks with:
```bash
cargo bench
```

The `benches/` directory contains organized benchmark suites:
- `core/` - Basic FST operations and algorithms
- `memory/` - Memory usage and storage benchmarks
- `io/` - Serialization and deserialization performance
- `optimization/` - Advanced optimization algorithms
- `parallel/` - Parallel processing benchmarks
