# Design Philosophy

ArcWeight's architecture reflects several key design philosophies that influence every implementation decision:

## Mathematical Fidelity

The implementation directly mirrors formal automata theory, ensuring that every operation has a solid theoretical foundation and maintains mathematical correctness.

## Performance Through Types

Rust's type system is leveraged extensively to provide zero-cost abstractions, compile-time optimization, and memory safety without runtime overhead.

## Modularity and Extensibility

Clean separation of concerns allows easy extension of the library with new semirings, FST types, and algorithms while maintaining API compatibility.

## Core Design Principles

### Type Safety Through Traits

ArcWeight uses Rust's trait system to ensure correctness at compile time:

```rust,ignore
// Algorithms specify exact requirements
// API Reference: https://docs.rs/arcweight/latest/arcweight/algorithms/fn.shortest_path.html
pub fn shortest_path<F, W, M>(fst: &F, config: ShortestPathConfig) -> Result<M>
where
    F: Fst<W>,                      // Must be an FST
    W: NaturallyOrderedSemiring,    // Must support ordering for shortest path
    M: MutableFst<W> + Default,     // Output FST type
```

### Zero-Cost Abstractions

Generic programming enables compile-time specialization without runtime overhead:

```rust,ignore
// Compiles to optimal code for each semiring type
let tropical_fst = VectorFst::<TropicalWeight>::new();
let boolean_fst = VectorFst::<BooleanWeight>::new();
```

### Separation of Concerns

Clear boundaries between different architectural layers:
- **Data structures** separate from **algorithms**
- **Algebraic operations** (semirings) separate from **graph operations**
- **I/O concerns** isolated from **computation logic**

## Architectural Principles Summary

The ArcWeight architecture embodies several key principles:

**1. Mathematical Correctness First**
- All operations respect formal automata theory
- Type system enforces mathematical constraints
- Properties tracked and validated automatically

**2. Performance Through Design**
- Zero-cost abstractions wherever possible
- Multiple storage strategies for different use cases
- Optimization opportunities at compile and runtime

**3. Extensibility and Modularity**
- Trait-based design enables easy extension
- Clean separation of concerns
- Plugin architecture for algorithms and data structures

**4. Rust-Native Design**
- Leverages Rust's strengths (safety, performance, concurrency)
- Follows Rust idioms and best practices
- Integrates well with the Rust ecosystem

**5. Production Ready**
- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensive testing and validation
- Documentation and examples for all features
