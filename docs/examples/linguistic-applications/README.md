# Linguistic Applications

**Advanced computational linguistics and theoretical phonology**

These examples implement sophisticated linguistic theories using FSTs, demonstrating morphological analysis and phonological rule systems.

## Examples in This Category

### [Morphological Analyzer](morphological_analyzer.md)
**Complexity:** Expert  
**Concepts:** Word structure analysis, morpheme segmentation  
```bash
cargo run --example morphological_analyzer
```

### [Phonological Rules](phonological_rules.md)
**Complexity:** Expert  
**Concepts:** Sound change rules, rule application, linguistic transformations  
```bash
cargo run --example phonological_rules
```

## Theoretical Foundation

These examples implement classical computational linguistics theories:
- **Two-level morphology** for word structure analysis
- **Generative phonology** for systematic sound changes
- **Rule-based systems** for linguistic transformations

## Prerequisites

These are the most advanced examples. We recommend completing the Text Processing Fundamentals first to understand FST operations.
