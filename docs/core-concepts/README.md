# Core Concepts

This section provides a mathematically rigorous introduction to Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) and semirings as implemented in ArcWeight. Building upon the foundational work in finite-state methods {{#cite mohri1997finite}} {{#cite kuich1986semirings}}, we assume familiarity with basic automata theory and focus on formal definitions, implementation details, and practical applications.
