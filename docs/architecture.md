# ArcWeight Architecture

## System Overview

ArcWeight is designed as a modular library for working with Finite State Transducers (FSTs) and Weighted FSTs (WFSTs). The architecture is built around several core components that work together to provide a flexible and efficient FST implementation.

## Core Components

### FST Module (`src/fst/`)
- Core FST data structures and operations
- State and arc management
- Basic FST operations (composition, determinization, minimization)

### Semiring Module (`src/semiring/`)
- Weight semiring implementations
- Common semirings (Tropical, Log, Probability)
- Custom semiring support

### Arc Module (`src/arc/`)
- Arc representation and manipulation
- Weight and label handling
- Arc optimization strategies

### Algorithms Module (`src/algorithms/`)
- FST algorithms implementation
- Graph traversal and manipulation
- Optimization techniques

### Properties Module (`src/properties/`)
- FST property checking
- Property propagation
- Property-based optimizations

### IO Module (`src/io/`)
- FST serialization/deserialization
- File format support
- Import/export functionality

## Component Interactions

### FST Construction and Manipulation
1. FST creation and state management
2. Arc addition and modification
3. Property checking and propagation
4. Algorithm application

### Weight Handling
1. Semiring operations
2. Weight propagation
3. Custom weight type integration

### IO Operations
1. FST serialization
2. Format conversion
3. Import/export handling
