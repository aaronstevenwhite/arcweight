# ArcWeight Architecture

Internal design and implementation guide for ArcWeight's FST library.

This section documents ArcWeight's internal architecture, design decisions, and implementation patterns for contributors and advanced users implementing custom FST types or algorithms.

> **Note**: For user documentation, see [Quick Start](../quick-start.md), [Core Concepts](../core-concepts/), and [Working with FSTs](../working-with-fsts/).
