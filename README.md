A high-performance, modular Rust library for weighted finite state transducers (WFSTs).

ArcWeight provides a comprehensive toolkit for constructing, combining, optimizing, and searching weighted finite-state transducers. It offers functionality comparable to OpenFST with a modern, type-safe Rust API.

## Features

- üöÄ **High Performance**: Optimized implementations with parallel algorithms support
- üîß **Modular Design**: Trait-based architecture for maximum extensibility
- üìä **Rich Semiring Support**: 
  - Tropical, Probability, Boolean, Log semirings
  - String, MinMax, and Product semirings
  - Custom semiring implementations
- üóÑÔ∏è **Multiple FST Types**: Vector, constant, compact, lazy, and cached implementations
- üîÑ **Comprehensive Algorithm Suite**:
  - Core operations: composition, determinization, minimization
  - Advanced operations: push, prune, project, replace
  - Path operations: shortest path, random path generation
  - Graph operations: connect, synchronize, topsort
- üìÅ **OpenFST Compatible**: Read and write OpenFST format files
- ü¶Ä **Pure Rust**: No C++ dependencies, fully memory safe
- üß™ **Extensive Benchmarks**: Performance testing for core operations, memory usage, and parallel algorithms

## Quick Start

Add ArcWeight to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
arcweight = "0.1"
```

Basic example:

```rust
use arcweight::prelude::*;

// Create a simple acceptor
let mut fst = VectorFst::<TropicalWeight>::new();
let s0 = fst.add_state();
let s1 = fst.add_state();
let s2 = fst.add_state();

fst.set_start(s0);
fst.set_final(s2, TropicalWeight::one());

// Add weighted transitions
fst.add_arc(s0, Arc::new(1, 1, TropicalWeight::new(0.5), s1));
fst.add_arc(s1, Arc::new(2, 2, TropicalWeight::new(0.3), s2));

// Find the shortest path
let shortest = shortest_path(&fst)?;
```
