# Design Philosophy

ArcWeight's architecture reflects key design principles that influence implementation decisions.

## Mathematical Fidelity

The implementation mirrors formal automata theory, ensuring operations maintain theoretical foundations and mathematical correctness.

## Performance Through Types

Rust's type system provides compile-time optimization and memory safety without runtime overhead.

## Modularity and Extensibility

Separation of concerns allows extension with new semirings, FST types, and algorithms while maintaining API compatibility.

## Core Design Principles

### Type Safety Through Traits

ArcWeight uses Rust's trait system to ensure correctness at compile time:

```rust,ignore
// Algorithms specify exact requirements
// API Reference: https://docs.rs/arcweight/latest/arcweight/algorithms/fn.shortest_path.html
pub fn shortest_path<F, W, M>(fst: &F, config: ShortestPathConfig) -> Result<M>
where
    F: Fst<W>,                      // Must be an FST
    W: NaturallyOrderedSemiring,    // Must support ordering for shortest path
    M: MutableFst<W> + Default,     // Output FST type
```

### Generic Programming

Generic programming enables compile-time specialization:

```rust,ignore
// Compiles to specialized code for each semiring type
let tropical_fst = VectorFst::<TropicalWeight>::new();
let boolean_fst = VectorFst::<BooleanWeight>::new();
```

### Separation of Concerns

Clear boundaries between architectural layers:
- Data structures separate from algorithms
- Algebraic operations (semirings) separate from graph operations
- I/O concerns isolated from computation logic

## Implementation Principles

**Mathematical Correctness**: Operations respect formal automata theory. The type system enforces mathematical constraints. Properties are tracked and validated automatically.

**Performance Through Design**: Multiple storage strategies for different use cases. Optimization opportunities at compile and runtime.

**Extensibility**: Trait-based design enables extension. Clean separation of concerns. Plugin architecture for algorithms and data structures.

**Rust-Native Design**: Follows Rust idioms and best practices. Integrates with the Rust ecosystem.

**Error Handling**: Type-safe error handling through Result types. Structured error categories for different failure modes.
